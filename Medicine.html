  <p style="text-align:justify;">Medicine is the science and practice of caring for a patient, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health.<br>
    Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness.<br>
    Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery,<br>
    but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.<br>

  Here's what happens when you take a pill:<br> 
1. Dissolution: The pill dissolves in your stomach.<br> 
2. Absorption: The body absorbs the medicine from your stomach into your bloodstream. The amount absorbed depends on the route of administration and the medicine's molecular properties.<br> 
3. Distribution: The blood distributes the medicine throughout your body.<br> 
4. Metabolism: The body sees medicines as foreign substances that need to be removed, and metabolism usually inactivates the medicine.<br>
    However, many medicines are inactive when you swallow them, so your liver chemically changes them into an active form that your body can use.<br> 
5. Target binding: The activated medication travels through your organs until it reaches a target receptor, which may be on the cell surface, in the liquid outside, or even in the cell center (nucleus).<br>
    The drug molecule attaches to the receptor, much like a key fits into a lock, and this triggers a response in the cell. This response can either turn on (stimulation) or turn off (inhibition) an effect,<br>
    which affects cellular activity.<br>
