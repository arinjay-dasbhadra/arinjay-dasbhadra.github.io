<p>By doing research scientists have found out that only cats who fall from places higher than 80 feet above the ground.<br>
This is so because once the cat fall from a certain height it take some time to go to its terminal velocity where it is ready to fall<br>
and by this time it has already passed 70 feet.<br>
After it has reached its terminal velocity stage it can twist itself in midair so that its feet are under them when it lands.<br>
This reflex keeps it from grinding into the ground face first or back first. Plus, cats have no working clavicles, flexible backbones,<br>
powerful back legs, and low body weight. These things work together to minimize the impact of a fall.</p>
